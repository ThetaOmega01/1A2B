# 1A2B

I wrote this to teach myself object-oriented programming in C++
and to practice modern C++ features.
The game is a simple number guessing game
where players try to guess a secret 4-digit number with unique digits.

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ..

cmake --build . --config Release  
```

## Usage

The game should be self-explanatory.

## TODO

- Implement solver

That's quite it for now.
